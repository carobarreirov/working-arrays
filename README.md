# working-arrays

My recommendation for the following exercises, that would also help me a lot to check code, is that you could send me the link or url of your task.

You do this from NextTech, in the Share icon (the first icon in the second icon group in the lower left corner). You will have the option to copy and give write access to the code.

This is for me to see what you have been working on and give more accurate advice. I think this tool is quite useful and you can avoid screenshots, videos or sending documents. 



For the exercise:

const numArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];



// TODO: declare the variable elementAtIndexFive and assign it the value of the element with index number 5 in the array numArray



// This will print the value of variable elementAtIndexFive to the console

console.log('The array element with index 5 is: ', elementAtIndexFive);



First I will recommend to only write and modify the code where a "TODO" is commented. 

In this case we will work on line 4 after the //TODO.



It says: "TODO: declare the variable elementAtIndexFive and assign it the value of the element with index number 5 in the array numArray."

We can declare the variable with a let and they are giving us the name so...
let elementAtIndexFive 

Then it says assign it the value and that would mean we have to use the equal sign 

let elementAtIndexFive =

Last, the value we have to assign would be the index number 5 in the array numArray

This index number 5 in the array numArray is ​numArray[5]

So our final code line would be

​let elementAtIndexFive = numArray[5];



When reviewing the rest of the exercise, there is no more TODOs to do so that line would be the only one to add.

With the following block of code our exercise should be complete.



const numArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];



// TODO: declare the variable elementAtIndexFive and assign it the value of the element with index number 5 in the array numArray

let elementAtIndexFive = numArray[5];



// This will print the value of variable elementAtIndexFive to the console

console.log('The array element with index 5 is: ', elementAtIndexFive);
